# simple-website
I have created a simple website that displays grocery list items and features a button to change the color scheme of the site.
To open the website:
  - copy and paste files and open in default browser on your preferred IDE
  - directly copy and paste link: file:///Users/lizabaranovska/simple-website/index.html

I am working on adding some cooler features and changing up the purpose of the site, as of right now it is a simple site and perfect for checking out the format of building a website using HTML5, CSS and Javascript.
